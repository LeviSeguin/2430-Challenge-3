This is a basic pong game. First, choose the score to play to with the buttons, then press "press to start".
Drag the brick to move it. You can aim the ball by hitting a certain spot on your brick.
The closer to the edge, the bigger the angle of the ball. The ball will slowly get faster and faster
each time it touches a brick, and will reset to default speed when someone scores.
